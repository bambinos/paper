This repository contains the code for **Bambi: A simple interface for fitting Bayesian linearmodels in Python**.

This repository contains two versions of the same code.

The `original` directory is the one we used while writing the manuscript. It contains code, figures, and instructions to set up the environment we originally used. This is the folder you need if you want to reproduce the results from the paper.

The `latest` directory only contains notebooks. These notebooks are kept updated with the latest release of Bambi.
